# Speed Comparison 🚄⏱️🚗

This is a small script developed as college exercise to compare the speed of two objects, given their distance and travel time, **entered by the user**.

## Description 📝 

The script prompts the user to enter four sets of values, two of them representing the distance and time of an object. Both values must be positive three-digit integers. The script performs the following operations:

1.  **Input validation**: Checks that the values entered by the user meet the requirements (positive three-digit integers).
2.  **Unit conversion**: Converts the distance from meters to kilometers (by dividing by 1000) and the time from minutes to hours (by dividing by 60).
3.  **Speed calculation**: Calculates the speed of each object by dividing the distance (in kilometers) by the time (in hours).
4.  **Speed comparison**: Compares the speeds of both objects and displays a message in the console indicating which is faster or if they are equal.

## How to use 🚀 

1.  **Prerequisites**: Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2.  **Navigate to the script directory**: Open the command line or terminal and navigate to the directory where the script file is located. You can use the `cd` (change directory) command for this. For example, if the script is in the "MyScripts" folder, you would use `cd MyScripts`.
3.  **Script execution**: Once you are in the correct directory, execute the script from the command line using the following command:

    ```bash
    python funyproc.py
    ```

4.  **Data entry**: The script will prompt you to enter the distance and time for each object, following the instructions in the console. **Make sure to enter positive three-digit integers.**
